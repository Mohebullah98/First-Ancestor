# First-Ancestor
An algorithm that finds the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree.

Using recursion, we check to see if x is a parent of y, or y is a parent of x as we move our way up the tree. The first place where x is a parent of y or vice versa is true is the first common ancestor.
